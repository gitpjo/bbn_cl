This directory contains the sources and binaries for BBN Butterfly
Common Lisp and BBN Butterfly Scheme.  These programs have been
publicly released by BBN for the use of the programming community.
This software is unlikely to run on any machine other than the
butterfly without significant work; but it might make a good starting
point for a free implementation of Common Lisp.
