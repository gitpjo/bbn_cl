Butterfly Lisp Release Notes
Addendum for Rel 2.00
las 4/6/90


			Bugs Repaired
   - Common Lisp only:

	- Prog* always returned a compiled procedure.
	- Defstruct :print-function did not accept a lambda-expr.
	- The dribble function produced infinite garbage as output.

   - Scheme and Common Lisp:

	- When gc-notification is on, system could bomb with "Illegal argument NIL to
	  system-vector-32b-ref", just before printing a gc notice.

	- I/O redirection failed miserably.  
	  Various problems here were repaired that account for interleaved
	  output in stdout files, echoing of input to the stdout file, and
	  premature termination of the system when redirecting io and using more
	  than one processor.

	- The multiple-value system could not return more than 8 or so
	  values reliably (Scheme/Common Lisp bombs).
