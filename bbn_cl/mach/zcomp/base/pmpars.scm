;;;; Very Simple Pattern Matcher: Parser

(declare (usual-integrations))

;;; PARSE-RULE and RULE-RESULT-EXPRESSION are used together to parse
;;; pattern/body definitions, producing Scheme code which can then be
;;; compiled.

;;; PARSE-RULE, given a PATTERN and a BODY, returns: (1) a pattern for
;;; use with the matcher; (2) the variables in the pattern, in the
;;; order that the matcher will produce their corresponding values;
;;; (3) a list of qualifier expressions; and (4) a list of actions
;;; which should be executed sequentially when the rule fires.

;;; RULE-RESULT-EXPRESSION is used to generate a lambda expression
;;; which, when passed the values resulting from the match as its
;;; arguments, will return either false, indicating that the
;;; qualifications failed, or the result of the body.
