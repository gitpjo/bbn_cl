/* NOTES ON FUTURES, derived from the rest of the interpreter code */

/* ASSUMPTION: The syntaxer is hereby assumed NEVER to generate primitive
   combinations unless the primitive itself is output in the code stream.
   Therefore, we don't have to explicitly check here that the expression
   register has a primitive in it.

   ASSUMPTION: The SYMBOL slot of a VARIABLE does NOT contain a future, nor
   do the cached lexical address slots.

   ASSUMPTION: History objects are never created using futures.

   ASSUMPTION: State points, which are created only by the interpreter,
   never contain FUTUREs except possibly as the thunks (which are handled
   by the apply code).

*/

/* OPTIMIZATIONS (?):
   After a lot of discussion, we decided that variable reference will check
   whether a value stored in the environment is a determined future which
   is marked spliceable.  If so, it will splice out the future from the
   environment slot to speed up subsequent references.

   EQ? does a normal identity check and only if this fails does it touch the
   arguments.  The same thing does not speed up MEMQ or ASSQ in the normal
   case, so it is omitted there.

   The following are NOT done, but might be useful later
   (1) Splicing on SET! operations
   (2) Splicing at apply and/or primitive apply
   (3) Splicing all arguments when a primitive errors on any of them
   (4) Splicing within the Arg_n_Type macro rather than after longjmping
       to the error handler.
*/

/* KNOWN PROBLEMS:
   (1) Garbage collector should be modified to splice out futures.  DONE.

   (2) Purify should be looked at and we should decide what to do about
       purifying an object with a reference to a future (it should probably
       become constant but not pure).

   (3) Look at Impurify and Side-Effect-Impurify to see if futures
       affect them in any way.
