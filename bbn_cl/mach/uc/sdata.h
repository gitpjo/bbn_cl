/* ENVIRONMENT
 * Associates identifiers with values.
 * The identifiers are either from a lambda-binding (as in a procedure
 * call) or a incremental (run-time) DEFINE (known as an 'auxilliary'
 * binding).
 * When an environment frame is created, it only contains lambda
 * bindings.  If incremental defines are performed in it or its
 * children, it acquires an extension which contains a list of the
 * auxiliary bindings.  Some of these bindings are fictitious in that
 * their only purpose is to make the real bindings (if and when they
 * occur) become automatically dangerous.  Bindings become dangerous
 * when they are shadowed by incremental bindings in children frames.
 * Besides the lambda bindings, an environment frame contains a
 * pointer to the procedure which created it.  It is through this
 * procedure that the parent frame is found.
 *
 * An environment frame has three distinct stages in its formation:
 * - A STACK_COMBINATION is the structure built on the stack to
 * evaluate normal (long) combinations.  It contains a slot for the
 * finger and the combination whose operands are being evaluated.
 * Only some of the argument slots in a stack-combination are
 * meaningful: those which have already been evaluated (those not
 * "hidden" by the finger).  This is the first stage.
 * - A STACK_ENVIRONMENT is the format used at Internal_Apply
 * just as an application is about to occur.
 * - An ENVIRONMENT is a real environment frame, containing
 * associations between names and values.  It is the final stage, and
 * corresponds to the structure described above.
