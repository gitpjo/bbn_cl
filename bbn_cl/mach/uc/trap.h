/* Kinds of traps:

   Note that for every trap there is a dangerous version.
   The danger bit is the bottom bit of the trap number,
   thus all dangerous traps are odd and viceversa.

   For efficiency, some traps are immediate, while some are
   pointer objects.  The type code is multiplexed, and the
   garbage collector handles it specially.
 */

#define TRAP_UNASSIGNED				0
#define TRAP_UNASSIGNED_DANGEROUS		1
#define TRAP_UNBOUND				2
#define TRAP_UNBOUND_DANGEROUS			3
#define TRAP_ILLEGAL				4
#define TRAP_ILLEGAL_DANGEROUS			5
#define TRAP_EXPENSIVE				6
